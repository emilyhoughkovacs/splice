Splice Take-Home February 2024

This repo provides my solution for the Splice take home. It consists of two parts corresponding to the two parts of the assignment.

## Part 1
In this directory you will find two files. `part1_data_exploration.md` is my solution to Part 1 of the assignment. `investigation_hit_numbers.md` is a further SQL investigation I performed after detecting some anomolies with the data.

## Part 2
In this directory you will find my solution to part 2. There are three `ipynb` files, two where I used the CatBoostClassifier model and one where I used a logistic regression. You can run them in any order, but they were written in this order:
1. `CatBoostClassifier_model_no_feature_encoding.ipynb`
2. `CatBoostClassifier_model_one_hot_encoding.ipynb`
3. `logistic_regression.ipynb`

There is a SQL file with the contents of the query I used to get the data for my analysis for part 2. Finally, the file `data_readout_writeup.md` is where I present my results for part 2 to the product manager.

Thank you so much!
